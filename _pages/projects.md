## 🔐 Capabilities of Microsoft Security Solutions

This lab explored several key components of the Microsoft Security suite. Below is a brief explanation of each lab completed:

---

### 1. 🌐 Explore Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs)

Azure NSGs help control inbound and outbound traffic to network interfaces (NIC), VMs, and subnets. In this lab, I learned to:

- View and configure security rules using the Azure portal.
- Apply NSGs to subnets to restrict unnecessary access.
- Understand default rules vs. custom rules.
- Test traffic filtering with different rule configurations.
