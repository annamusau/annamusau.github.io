## 🔐 Capabilities of Microsoft Security Solutions

This lab explored several key components of the Microsoft Security suite. Below is a brief explanation of each lab completed:

---

### 1. 🌐 Explore Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs)

Azure NSGs help control inbound and outbound traffic to network interfaces (NIC), VMs, and subnets. In this lab, I learned to:

- View and configure security rules using the Azure portal.
- Apply NSGs to subnets to restrict unnecessary access.
- Understand default rules vs. custom rules.
- Test traffic filtering with different rule configurations.

## ✅ Lab 2 – Exercise 1: Manage DLP Policies

🔧 In this exercise, I:

- Created a new DLP policy in Microsoft Purview Compliance Portal  
- Defined rules for detecting sensitive data (e.g., financial info, PII)  
- Scoped the policy to Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDrive  
- Configured user notifications and policy tips
