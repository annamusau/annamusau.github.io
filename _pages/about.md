title: "About me"
---
I am a data-driven professional with expertise in analytics, customer insights, and data protection. With a strong foundation in data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and storytelling, I transform complex data into clear, actionable insights that drive strategic decisions and measurable business impact.

Passionate about the ethical and secure use of data, I aim to not only solve business problems and improve customer experiences but also ensure compliance with data protection laws. I have hands-on knowledge of data privacy frameworks such as Kenya’s Data Protection Act and the GDPR, enabling organizations to align with regulatory standards while leveraging data for innovation and growth.



## Let’s Connect

I'm currently **open to Junior Data Analyst roles** or **opportunities in customer insights, data analytics, or data privacy**. If you're hiring or would like to collaborate, I’d love to connect!
